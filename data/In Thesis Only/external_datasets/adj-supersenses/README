The released resources include:

--classifier_predicted_supersenses
  --word_types.predicted
    Supersense tagging of adjective types in WordNet. 
    A vector for each adjective *type* corresponds to  
    its degrees of membership in one of the 13 semantic classes.
    Degrees of membership are classifier posterior probabilities.
 
  --synsets.predicted
    Supersense tagging of adjective synsets in WordNet. 
    A vector for each adjective *synset* corresponds to  
    its degrees of membership in one of the 13 semantic classes.
    Synset vectors are constructed by soft voting of all word vectors 
    in the synset (from the word_types.predicted file).

--MTurk_annotations
  --synsets+annotations+MACE.txt 
    SemCor adjectives annotated by 3-5 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. 
    Responses for each lemma are aggregated with the MACE tool, which takes 
    annotator-specific patterns into account to better determine the true label.

--manual_annotations
    Manually annotated adjective types, for each of the 13 classes. 
    We use these annotations to train the supersense classifier:

--eval
    Adjective supersenses test set, manually labeled by two annotators, 
    and evaluation results.
