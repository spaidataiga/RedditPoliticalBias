Yet the New York Times has now reported that ’s Russia probe came about when Trump adviser George Papadopoulos boasted to an Australian diplomat in May of 2016 that he’d learned Russia had dirt on Clinton in the form of thousands of emails, which the Australians then passed on to Americans, resulting in the original FBI investigation now run by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n",

Yet the New York Times has now reported that ’s Russia probe came about when Trump adviser George Papadopoulos boasted to an Australian diplomat in May of 2016 that he’d learned Russia had dirt on Clinton in the form of thousands of emails, which the Australians then passed on to Americans, resulting in the original FBI investigation now run by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n",

The applicant simply logs on to USCIS and changes The applicant employer name and new salary. This immediately gets rid of the IT sweatshops that force applicants to work 80-hour weeks under the table. This also removes the wage-depressing aspect of the visas. Companies that hire candidates for candidates genuine expertise and treat candidates well should not have any issue with this.\n",

      "As someone quite familiar with the industry and the process of H1-B, here's how to fix H1-B without hurting citizens, the job market, the applicants, or the companies who need expert candidates to grow:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Allow H1-B applicants to switch jobs after 3mo of start to any company who is willing to pay a higher salary without requiring any paperwork from the new employer. The applicant simply logs on to USCIS and changes The applicant employer name and new salary. This immediately gets rid of the IT sweatshops that force applicants to work 80-hour weeks under the table. This also removes the wage-depressing aspect of the visas. Companies that hire candidates for candidates genuine expertise and treat candidates well should not have any issue with this.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) For each applicant that a company sponsors, a company has to pay an additional fee (say 25%-30%) of the applicant's salary for 3 years to \"American Citizen Adult Training\" fund. Even if the applicant leaves for another job or returns back to the applicant home country, a company still has to pay this. this prevents companies from sponsoring workers just to source companies to bigger companies or pulling any immigration shenanigans.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) US Citizens can now get grants to be educated in the same industries that sponsor the visas. If IT sponsors 60k jobs, there will be a lot of grants available for IT training. If H1-Bs are suddenly used in a new field like biotech, immediately citizens can apply for grants in the same field.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it is worth it for Facebook or Wipro to pay prevailing wages (already in the law) + 30% salary for training of citizens, and citizens know citizens H1-B hires could switch to Google, IBM, or any startup without requiring any paperwork after 90 days, citizens will either sponsor people who are truly worth it or hire citizens/resident aliens because it is a safer bet. Or citizens could continue to do what many are already doing - open offshore branches to avoid the H1-B process completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally just #1 above (with some restrictions to prevent shenanigans) would be enough to 'fix' the worst aspects of H1-B.\n",

      " alternative is? As long as A Republican Party that supported Roy Moore demonizes pro-life candidates, the republicans own evangelicals. the republicans can say/do whatever the republicans want, as long as the republicans don't support \"Murdering babies\" as the evangelicals see it. \n",
